# D|R|P PMS — Architecture

Dubai-first property management system for D|R|P: long-term leasing, Holiday
Homes, owner and tenant portals, finance and compliance.

Everything below is UAE-native rather than a generic PMS with local fields bolted
on. AED is the base currency, VAT is decided per line item, and the regulators
(RERA/DLD via Ejari, DET formerly DTCM, Mollak) are modelled as first-class
concerns rather than free-text notes.

---

## 1. Stack and why

| Layer | Choice | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript | Server Components + Server Actions; no separate API tier needed for the back office |
| Database | Supabase Postgres | Row Level Security is the access-control mechanism, not an add-on |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | `profiles.role` drives both RLS and the UI |
| Data access | Supabase typed client | Chosen over Drizzle deliberately — see below |
| Storage | Supabase Storage behind `lib/storage` | Private buckets, short-lived signed URLs |
| UI | Tailwind v4 + hand-rolled shadcn-style primitives on Radix | |
| Deploy | Vercel initially | Nothing assumes Vercel; see §7 |

**Why the Supabase client rather than Drizzle.** The brief allowed either. RLS is
the security boundary here, and Drizzle talks to Postgres over a direct
connection that bypasses RLS entirely — every query would have to re-implement
the access rules in TypeScript, and any missed `where` clause becomes a data
leak. The Supabase client carries the user's JWT, so the database enforces
access on every query. Types are generated from the live schema by
`scripts/gen-types.mjs`, so the SQL migrations stay the single source of truth
and the two cannot drift.

---

## 2. Database schema

55 tables, 5 views, 48 enums. Full DDL in `supabase/migrations/`, applied in
filename order.

| Migration | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0001_foundation` | Extensions, all enums, the private `pms` helper schema |
| `0002_identity_property` | `profiles`, `company_settings`, community → property → unit, media, staff scoping |
| `0003_owners` | Owners, bank accounts, fractional ownership, management agreements |
| `0004_leasing` | Tenancies, occupants, cheque schedules, deposits, rent-increase and other notices, UAEDDS mandates |
| `0005_short_term` | DET permits, channel listings, pricing hooks, guests, bookings, availability, housekeeping |
| `0006_finance` | GL categories, ledger, invoices, payments, Mollak service charges, owner statements |
| `0007_maintenance_documents` | Vendors, tickets, preventive maintenance, document vault, compliance alerts, audit log |
| `0008_crm_comms_addons` | Leads, viewings, message templates and log, service orders, fleet |
| `0009_views_access` | RLS helper functions and the reporting views |
| `0010_rls` | Row Level Security policies for every table |
| `0011_functions` | Reference numbering, cheque schedules, statement generation, storage buckets |
| `0012_grants` | Explicit privilege grants; `anon` gets nothing |
| `0013_current_profile` | One-round-trip profile lookup (see §8) |

                               ├─< bookings ─< booking_guests   (guest registration)

                               └─< documents                    (vault)
```

### Rules the database enforces (not the UI)

These are constraints and triggers, so they hold regardless of which client
writes the data:

- **Ownership shares cannot exceed 100%** per unit (`check_ownership_total`).
- **No overlapping tenancies** on a unit — a GiST exclusion constraint over
  `(unit_id, daterange(start, end))` for non-terminal statuses.
- **No double bookings** — the same, half-open so a same-day
  checkout→check-in turnaround is still allowed.
- **No short-term listing or booking without a valid DET permit.**
  `enforce_permit_before_listing` and `enforce_permit_before_booking` reject the
  write and stamp the permit number onto the listing (DET requires it on every
  OTA listing) and onto the booking record.
- **Maintenance above the configured threshold cannot start without owner
  approval** — `flag_owner_approval` raises if the status advances while
  `owner_approved_at` is null.
- **Ejari occupant currency** — any change to `lease_occupants` clears
  `leases.ejari_occupants_synced_at`, which starts the 30-day clock the
  compliance calendar reports on (2026 requirement).
- **Rent-increase notices** must respect the statutory notice period:
  `effective_date >= notice_date + required_notice_days`.
- **Audit trail** — `pms.write_audit()` fires on every financial and compliance
  table. It is `SECURITY DEFINER` and `audit_log` has no insert policy, so
  application code cannot bypass or forge it.

### Money and VAT

Every stored amount is AED and VAT-exclusive; `vat_amount_aed` is separate and
`total_aed` is generated. **VAT applicability is a per-line-item flag, never a
document-level or global rule** — long-term residential rent is exempt while the
management fee on the very same owner statement is standard-rated. Defaults come
from `gl_categories.default_vat_applicable`, which Finance can configure; each
line can override. The rate itself lives in `company_settings.vat_rate`.

Foreign currency exists only for display to guests (`quoted_currency`,
`fx_rate_to_aed` on bookings). It never enters the ledger.

`generate_owner_statement()` computes:

```
net payout = collected income − owner expenses (incl. VAT) − management fee − VAT on fee
```

Every line is **snapshotted** onto `owner_statement_lines` and the source ledger
row is stamped with the statement id, so the same income can never be paid out
twice and re-issuing a statement cannot silently restate history.

### Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `v_units_overview` | The unit list/card shape — property, owner, live lease, live permit, cover image, open tickets |
| `v_compliance_calendar` | Union of every expiry: Ejari, occupant declarations, tenancy, DET permit, NOC, management agreement, any vault document, preventive maintenance, fleet |
| `v_compliance_status` | The above with severity banding (`ok` / `due_soon` / `urgent` / `overdue`) |
| `v_unit_financials` | Per-unit monthly income/expense rollup |
| `v_occupancy_daily` | Long-term vs short-term occupancy per unit per day |

All are `security_invoker`, so RLS follows through the view.

---

## 3. Access control

Two layers, and only one of them is the security boundary.

**The database (authoritative).** Every table has RLS enabled *and forced*.
Policies resolve a user to the units they may see through helper functions in
the private `pms` schema:

| Role | Sees |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | Everything |
| `finance` | Everything financial; no property CRUD |
| `property_manager`, `agent`, `maintenance` | Only units assigned via `staff_unit_assignments` / `staff_property_assignments` — deny by default |
| `marketing` | Units and listing content; never financials |
| `owner` | Units they own, via `owner_users → unit_ownerships`; issued statements only |
| `tenant` | Their own tenancy, via `tenants.profile_id` |
| `guest` | Their current/recent booking, via `guests.profile_id` |

The helpers (`pms.can_read_unit`, `pms.can_read_lease`, `pms.is_my_tenant_record`
…) are `SECURITY DEFINER`. That is not incidental: policies on `leases` and
`tenants` referencing each other directly caused genuine infinite policy
recursion, and wrapping each cross-table lookup in a definer function is what
breaks the cycle.

`owner_bank_accounts` and documents flagged `is_sensitive` are restricted
further — finance and admin only, plus the party the record belongs to.

**The application (cosmetic).** `src/lib/auth/rbac.ts` holds a capability matrix
used to decide what to render and which routes to offer. It mirrors the policies
but is *not* relied on for safety: the database refuses anything it would
wrongly allow.

The `service_role` key bypasses RLS entirely and is used only for background
jobs (alert sweeps, scheduled statement runs) — never to serve a user request.

---

## 4. Route structure

```
/                             → redirect by role
/login                        credentials
/setup                        shown when Supabase is not configured

(staff)  — back office, requires a staff role
  /dashboard                  portfolio, compliance exposure, month position
  /compliance                 unified renewal calendar + health score
  /properties                 buildings and compounds
  /properties/new             create, with inline community creation
  /units                      filterable list + CSV export
  /units/new                  create, with ownership captured at the same time
  /units/[id]                 overview · tenancy · DET permits · documents
  /owners                     list + CSV export
  /owners/new                 create, incl. restricted payout details
  /owners/[id]                profile · units · statements · documents
  /leases                     list, with the 90-day notice window flagged
  /leases/new                 contract + cheque schedule in one step
  /leases/[id]                details · payments · occupants · documents
  /finance                    ledger with VAT per line
  /finance/statements         list, generate
  /finance/statements/[id]    printable A4 statement
  /settings                   VAT, fees, notice periods, thresholds

portal   — owners, tenants, guests
  /portal/owner               income, occupancy, approvals waiting on them
  /portal/owner/units
  /portal/owner/statements    issued statements only
  /portal/owner/statements/[id]
  /portal/owner/maintenance   approve or decline quotes above threshold
  /portal/owner/documents
  /portal/tenant              tenancy, payment schedule, documents
  /portal/guest               booking and check-in details
```

Navigation is generated from capabilities (`components/layout/nav.ts`), so
granting a capability in `rbac.ts` surfaces the matching section automatically.
Only built routes are listed there — Phase 2 surfaces are added as they are
built rather than left as dead links, so the delivered app has none.

---

## 5. Shared components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `domain/shared.tsx` | `PageHeader`, `StatCard`, `Money`, `Field`/`FieldGrid`, `EmptyState`, `Callout` |
| `domain/status-badge.tsx` | One badge per domain status, with fixed colour semantics: green healthy, amber attention, red blocking, grey inert |
| `domain/document-list.tsx` + `document-uploader.tsx` | The vault UI. Statutory document types require an expiry date, which is what keeps the compliance calendar complete |
| `domain/statement-document.tsx` | The printable owner statement |
| `domain/export-button.tsx` | RFC 4180 CSV export, on every table |
| `layout/sidebar.tsx` | Capability-filtered navigation, responsive drawer |
| `lib/labels.ts` | Every enum → human label. This is the seam an Arabic locale layer plugs into |

Documents are never public: the buckets are private and the UI mints a
five-minute signed URL on click, after RLS has already decided the user may see
the row.

PDFs are produced by print stylesheet rather than a PDF engine — smaller,
searchable, keeps Arabic selectable, and no extra dependency.

---

## 6. Integration seams

All stubbed behind interfaces so business logic never branches on a vendor:

| Concern | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Payments | `lib/payments` | `manual` driver (cheques, transfers) is the default and real. Ziina/Telr/Network/Stripe drivers are declared and throw until implemented |
| WhatsApp / email / SMS | `lib/messaging` | WhatsApp Business API and Resend implemented; no-op driver logs instead of sending when unconfigured |
| Storage | `lib/storage` | Supabase driver live; S3 driver stubbed for an AWS move |
| Channel manager | `channel_listings` table | Data model and sync fields exist; OTA API calls are Phase 3 |
| Dynamic pricing | `pricing_connections`, `nightly_rates` | Integration point only — the pricing engine stays external |
| E-signature | `leases.signature_provider` / `signature_reference` | Provider-agnostic fields so UAE Pass / Dubai REST needs no migration |
| Direct debit | `direct_debit_mandates` | UAEDDS record exists; collection flow is Phase 3 |

---

## 7. Portability

The brief asked that a later move into D|R|P's AWS account not be made harder
than necessary:

- **No configuration in code.** Everything enters through `src/lib/env.ts`;
  nothing else reads `process.env` (bar the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_` values the browser
  bundle must inline).
- **Storage behind an interface**, with the S3 driver already stubbed.
- **Nothing assumes Vercel** — no `@vercel/*` imports, no platform-specific APIs.
  The frontend can move to Amplify or ECS unchanged.
- **The schema is plain PostgreSQL.** Supabase-specific surface is confined to
  `auth.uid()`, `auth.users` and `storage.*`. `supabase/local/00_shim.sql`
  reproduces exactly that surface, which is how the whole schema is tested
  against stock Postgres — and is also the shape of the work if the backend ever
  moves to RDS + Cognito.

---

## 8. Performance

Measured against a live Supabase project from Colombo, with the project in a
distant region:

| | |
|---|---|
| Round trip to Supabase | ~176 ms |
| Query execution itself | ~15 ms |
| Added by RLS | ~15 ms |
| Page load, `npm run dev` | 1,400-2,300 ms |
| Page load, production build | 410-540 ms |

Two things follow from this.

**The database is not the bottleneck.** Warm queries land within a few
milliseconds of the raw network round trip, RLS included. Do not optimise SQL
here without measuring first.

**Region choice dominates.** Each page makes a small number of sequential hops
to Supabase (session refresh in the proxy, profile lookup, then the page's own
queries run in parallel). At 176 ms per hop that is ~420 ms of pure distance.
Hosting the project near the operator - `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) or
`ap-southeast-1` (Singapore) for a Dubai/Colombo team - takes the round trip to
40-60 ms and pages to roughly 200 ms. A project's region cannot be changed after
creation, so this is worth getting right before go-live.

**Current setup:** Supabase in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai), Vercel functions in `bom1`
(Mumbai, `vercel.json`), so the server and the database sit in the same region.
Measured from Dubai when the project moved from `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney): one
round trip 409 ms -> 65 ms; the unit page's full data batch ~400 ms (spikes over
1 s) -> ~80-140 ms. Pages also send all their queries as one parallel batch, so
each page costs a single round trip. `scripts/copy-supabase-project.mjs` is how
the data was moved, and can move it again.

Two fixes already applied:

- `current_profile()` (migration 0013) returns the signed-in user's profile in
  one round trip instead of `getUser()` followed by a select. Worth ~180 ms per
  page. The app falls back to the two-call path if the function is absent, and
  remembers that for the process rather than retrying every request.
- The proxy matcher exempts `manifest.webmanifest`, icons and fonts. Without
  that the browser's manifest request on every page load was redirected to
  `/login`, costing a round trip and leaving the PWA manifest unreadable.

Always benchmark with `npm run build && npm run start`; `npm run dev` compiles
on demand and is roughly three times slower, which is not representative.

---

## 9. Verification

The schema is not just written; it is exercised.

```bash
bash supabase/local/rebuild.sh     # migrations + 17 assertions against real Postgres
```

`supabase/local/02_smoke_test.sql` asserts the rules the brief treats as
non-negotiable: ownership ≤ 100%, cheque splits with no rounding loss, cleared
rent posting as VAT-exempt income, owner statement arithmetic, the DET permit
gate on both listings and bookings, no double-booking (but same-day turnaround
allowed), Ejari occupant staleness surfacing in the compliance calendar, the
maintenance approval threshold, and RLS isolation between two owners, a tenant
and a scoped property manager.

---

## 10. Scope delivered

**Phase 1, end to end:** auth and roles; property, unit and owner management
with create forms; long-term leasing with Ejari, cheque schedules and occupant
declarations; finance with the ledger and owner statements; the document vault;
and the compliance dashboard. Tenant and guest logins get a minimal read-only
portal so no role lands on a dead route.

Edit forms for units, owners and properties are not built — records are created
through the app and amended in the database or the Supabase table editor for
now. Everything else in Phase 1 is complete.

**Phase 2 data model is complete** — Holiday Homes, DET permits, bookings,
housekeeping, maintenance and the communication hub all have their tables,
constraints, RLS and seed data. Their back-office screens are the next build
step; no migration will be needed to add them.

**Phase 3** (OTA sync, CRM, analytics, interior design and fleet, Arabic pass,
UAE Pass, UAEDDS) has tables and integration points reserved, nothing more.
